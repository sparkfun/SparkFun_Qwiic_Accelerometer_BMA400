The SparkFun Qwiic BMA400 Triple Axis Accelerometer Breakout offers a 3-axis acceleration sensor perfect for ultra-low-power applications on an easy-to-use Qwiic breakout board. Dubbed the first "real" ultra-low power acceleration sensor, the BMA400 is perfect when used in both wearable and smart home applications. Where this sensor shines, however, is its ability to distinguish between critical situations and false signals by avoiding false alarms. The Qwiic system allows for integration into your I<sup>2</sup>C system with no soldering required. This Qwiic breakout also includes 0.1"-spaced PTH pins connected to the sensor's communication interface and interrupt pins for applications that require a traditional soldered connection.

The BMA400 from Bosch Sensortech<sup>&copy;</sup> has a full-scale acceleration range of &plusmn;2/&plusmn;4/&plusmn;8/&plusmn;16g with exceptionally low current consumption of < 14.5&micro;A while operating at its highest performance settings. The sensor also includes a complete feature set for on-chip interrupts including auto wakeup/low power, step counter, activity recognition, orientation detection, and tap/double tap.
